# simplebudget
A quick and dirty single page tool to track spending between pay periods

## Purpose
Sometimes it's difficult to track how much money should be left in your bank account or is still in your budget. Because of the delay between using a card and when it posts, checking your bank account isn't always the best way to check. Plus, if you've already paid bills or have some bills on auto-pay but have set aside a portion of that money as your budget between this pay day and the next, then you might want to have a simple tool to track it.

## How it works
Enter how much you have to spend in a given period and initialize a new period. Then just press the button to display fields to fill in what you purchased and the total. Each time you finish entering a purchase it will be deducted from your total and you will know exactly how much you have left to spend.
